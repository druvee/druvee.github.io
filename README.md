Welcome to Andrew Volz's github page. Since mid 2019, this page hosts an collection of small tools and open source projects related to urban planning and real estate analysis that I am currently working on.

## Zoning Reclassification Text to Geometry
zrc2geom (repo currently private)

Zoning changes are legislative acts which enumerate a municipalities values and goals for the built environment. Frequently, zoning power is misused or applied unevenly tot he detriment of the city as a whole. While a record of zoning exists as far back as any municpalities' legislative records go, these unfortunately predate GIS and are rendered unusable for modern analysis by virtue of being locked in text. zrc2geom tackles the problem of record digitization by exploiting consistent structures in the descriptions to generate [Shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely) geometries from publicly available streetline and other existing data.
## Office Market Internal Transition Dynamics
OMITD (repo currently private)

Created in collaboration with UIC's College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs, OMITD is an agent based model of commercial real estate markets. The model itself is written in Netlogo with supporting analysis in Python.
